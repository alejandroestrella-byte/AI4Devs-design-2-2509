Estimate the effort of work tickets using the poker methodology and units (hours, story points)
ChatGPT said:

Excellent — let’s apply Agile Poker estimation to your Interview Management (P1) tickets.

We’ll estimate both:

Story Points (SP) — based on complexity, uncertainty, and team effort.

Effort Hours (H) — approximate time if 1 SP ≈ 4 hours (standard Fibonacci scale).

🎯 Epic: Interview Management (P1 – Critical Workflow)
Ticket ID	Title	Complexity Factors	Story Points (SP)	Effort Estimate (Hours)	Estimation Notes
IM-101	Schedule Interview	API integration (Google/Outlook), validation, notifications	8 SP	~32 hrs	Medium–high complexity due to 3rd-party API sync and time-zone logic
IM-102	Assign Interview Panel	CRUD logic + validation rules	5 SP	~20 hrs	Moderate; mainly UI and backend update to panel field
IM-103	Submit Interview Feedback (Scorecard)	Structured form + business validation + DB write	8 SP	~32 hrs	Medium-high complexity; includes permissions and data aggregation
IM-104	View Aggregated Feedback	Read API + aggregation logic	5 SP	~20 hrs	Straightforward; mostly data retrieval and average calculations
IM-105	Decision Room Collaboration	Real-time WebSocket, voting logic, UI updates	13 SP	~52 hrs	High complexity: real-time synchronization and concurrency handling
IM-106	Interview Reminders & Rescheduling	Background jobs + email notifications	5 SP	~20 hrs	Moderate; requires job queue and calendar update API
IM-107	Interview Cancellation	CRUD + calendar API delete call + notifications	3 SP	~12 hrs	Low complexity; single endpoint and UI update
IM-108	Interview Stage Automation	Event trigger (Kafka) + workflow rule engine	5 SP	~20 hrs	Medium; backend automation and message queue integration
🧮 Total Epic Estimate

Total Story Points: 52 SP

Total Estimated Effort: ≈ 208 hours (~5.2 weeks for 1 developer or ~2.5 weeks for a 2-person team)

🧠 Estimation Rationale (Agile Poker Scale)
Scale	Meaning	Example from this Epic
1 SP	Very small, trivial task	N/A in this epic
3 SP	Small, well-defined	IM-107 (Cancel Interview)
5 SP	Medium, moderate complexity	IM-102, IM-104, IM-106, IM-108
8 SP	Complex task with external systems	IM-101, IM-103
13 SP	Very complex, uncertain	IM-105 (Decision Room)

Assumptions:

Team velocity: ~30 SP per sprint (2 weeks).

Therefore, Interview Management epic would span ~2 sprints.

QA effort included in SP; hours assume design, development, and testing.
